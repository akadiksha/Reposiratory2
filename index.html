 PROCESS IMPROVEMENT PROJECT (2021-2022) 
During ITGC audit, while acting as administrator cum facilitator a lot of gaps were observed and 
proactively, I proposed a process improvement project. This was first-of-its-kind structured 
improvement plan. 
Salient features: 
1. All the gaps listed during the audit process were compiled, categorized into resources (cost, 
time, employee efforts) required and risk associated. 
2. Accordingly, with the help of regional and software system SPOCs, priorities were assigned, 
and process improvement project was chalked out targeting the gaps. 
3. A regular review on the progress was made at central level. 
4. Common IT support request tracker was introduced which created platform for tracking 
employee load and vendor performance.
5. Regular scheduled meetings were proposed with the vendor to ensure tracking of schedules 
and mitigate the delays if any. 
6. IT SOPs were designed from scratch for user and asset management, change management 
and administration. 
This project yielded up to 60 percent of more compliant systems within 6 months and 80 percent 
before review audit amongst the highlighted points. It ended in reconsideration of software choices 
and paved the way to major upgradation in application infrastructure of the company which 
will continue for a decade at the very minimum.
